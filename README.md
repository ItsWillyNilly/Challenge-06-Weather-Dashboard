# Challenge-06-Weather-Dashboard
This is an weather dashboard created using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, JQuery, Bootstrap, and OpenWeather API.

## Description
I was tasked with creating a weather dashboard from start to finish utilizing OpenWeather, a server API. The app takes in a request from the user about what city they would like to look up and the app will display the weather for the current day and also a five day forecast. After, the search history is displayed on the right side of the browser with previously searched locations.

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
